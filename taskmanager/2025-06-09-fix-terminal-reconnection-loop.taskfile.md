# Task: Fix Terminal WebSocket Infinite Reconnection Loop

**Start Time:** Mon Jun 9 10:52:30 PM EAT 2025

**Description:** Fix the infinite reconnection loop issue where dead shell sessions caused continuous failed WebSocket connection attempts, and resolve duplicate connection handling in React StrictMode.

**Status:** ✅ Completed

## Problem Analysis:

### Initial Issue

- When shell sessions died (due to connection failures), the frontend TerminalWebSocket service would endlessly try to reconnect to the same dead shell ID
- The backend had already cleaned up the shell from `ACTIVE_SHELLS`, but frontend kept trying to connect
- This created infinite 403 Forbidden responses and retry loops

### React StrictMode Issue

- React's StrictMode in development causes components to mount/unmount twice
- This leads to duplicate WebSocket connection attempts for the same shell
- Backend was rejecting second connections with "Shell already has active connection"
- Rejection of second connection caused first connection to fail and cascade cleanup
- Shell would be removed from `ACTIVE_SHELLS`, leading to the infinite loop

## Steps Taken:

### 1. ✅ Enhanced Frontend Dead Shell Detection

- **Modified `TerminalWebSocket` class** to detect dead shells:
  - Added constructor parameter `onShellDead` callback
  - Added detection for specific error codes (403, 1008) indicating shell doesn't exist
  - Added logic to stop reconnection after max attempts and notify parent
  - Added `handleShellDead()` method to cleanup and notify

### 2. ✅ Updated Terminal Component

- **Modified `Terminal.tsx`**:
  - Added `onShellDead` prop to handle dead shell notifications
  - Passed dead shell callback to TerminalWebSocket constructor
  - Added proper callback handling with `useCallback`

### 3. ✅ Enhanced TerminalManager Auto-Recovery

- **Modified `TerminalManager.tsx`**:
  - Added `handleShellDead` function that:
    - Removes dead shell from session list
    - Automatically creates new shell to replace dead one
    - Switches to new shell if dead one was active
  - Passed `onShellDead` prop to Terminal components

### 4. ✅ Fixed Backend Duplicate Connection Handling

- **Modified `backend/main.py`**:
  - Changed duplicate connection logic from rejection to replacement
  - Instead of closing new connection with 403, close old connection gracefully
  - Allow new connection to proceed, preventing cascade failures
  - Added proper error handling for old connection cleanup

## Key Code Changes:

### Frontend - TerminalWebSocket Service:

```typescript
export class TerminalWebSocket {
  private onShellDead?: (shellId: string) => void;

  constructor(onShellDead?: (shellId: string) => void) {
    this.onShellDead = onShellDead;
  }

  // Detect specific error codes for dead shells
  if (event.code === 1008 || event.code === 403) {
    this.handleShellDead();
    return;
  }

  // Stop infinite reconnection
  } else if (this.reconnectAttempts >= this.maxReconnectAttempts) {
    this.handleShellDead();
  }

  private handleShellDead(): void {
    if (this.onShellDead && this.shellId) {
      this.onShellDead(this.shellId);
    }
    this.disconnect();
  }
}
```

### Frontend - TerminalManager Auto-Recovery:

```typescript
const handleShellDead = useCallback(
  async (deadShellId: string) => {
    // Remove dead shell
    setShellSessions((prev) =>
      prev.filter((shell) => shell.shell_id !== deadShellId)
    );

    // Create replacement shell
    const newShell = await api.createShellSession(sessionId);
    setShellSessions((prev) => [...prev, newShell]);

    // Switch to replacement if dead shell was active
    if (activeTab === deadShellId) {
      setActiveTab(newShell.shell_id);
    }
  },
  [sessionId, activeTab]
);
```

### Backend - Graceful Connection Replacement:

```python
# Instead of rejecting duplicate connections
if shell_session.websocket is not None:
    logger.warning(f"Shell {shell_id} already has active connection, replacing it")
    try:
        old_websocket = shell_session.websocket
        shell_session.websocket = None
        await old_websocket.close(code=1000, reason="Replaced by new connection")
    except Exception as e:
        logger.warning(f"Failed to close old WebSocket: {e}")
    # Continue with new connection
```

## Technical Improvements:

### 1. **Smart Reconnection Logic**

- Detects permanent failures vs temporary network issues
- Stops infinite loops when shell truly doesn't exist
- Provides automatic recovery with new shell creation

### 2. **React StrictMode Compatibility**

- Handles duplicate component mounting gracefully
- Replaces old connections instead of rejecting new ones
- Prevents cascade failures from duplicate connections

### 3. **User Experience Enhancement**

- Seamless transition when shells die - user doesn't notice
- Automatic recovery without manual intervention
- No more infinite connection attempts cluttering logs

### 4. **Resource Management**

- Proper cleanup of dead WebSocket connections
- Prevents memory leaks from zombie connections
- Efficient shell session lifecycle management

## Testing Results:

### Before Fix:

- ❌ Infinite reconnection loops when shells died
- ❌ Cascade failures from React StrictMode duplicate connections
- ❌ Shells getting removed unintentionally
- ❌ Terminal tabs becoming permanently unusable

### After Fix:

- ✅ Dead shells detected and replaced automatically
- ✅ React StrictMode duplicate connections handled gracefully
- ✅ No more infinite reconnection loops
- ✅ Seamless user experience with automatic recovery

## Modified Files:

- **frontend/src/services/terminalWebSocket.ts**: Enhanced dead shell detection and callback system
- **frontend/src/components/Terminal.tsx**: Added dead shell handling prop
- **frontend/src/components/TerminalManager.tsx**: Added auto-recovery for dead shells
- **backend/main.py**: Fixed duplicate connection handling logic

## Duration:

Approximately 45 minutes of analysis and implementation

## Summary:

Successfully fixed the terminal WebSocket infinite reconnection loop by implementing smart dead shell detection on the frontend and graceful duplicate connection handling on the backend. The solution provides automatic recovery with seamless user experience and handles React StrictMode development quirks properly.
