# Task: Implement Conversation Workflow Rendering with Tool Calls

**Start Time:** Mon Jun 9 06:22:39 PM EAT 2025

**Description:** Implement comprehensive conversation workflow rendering feature to display the full agent session data including tool calls, reasoning steps, and outputs in an organized, visually appealing format.

**Status:** ✅ Completed

## Steps Breakdown:

1. ✅ Analyze existing session data structure with rich conversation history
2. ✅ Create new backend API endpoint for full conversation data
3. ✅ Add TypeScript types for conversation history items
4. ✅ Update API service with new endpoint method
5. ✅ Create ConversationWorkflow component with rich visualization
6. ✅ Integrate workflow view into main application
7. ✅ Add toggle functionality between chat and workflow views
8. ✅ Test backend endpoints and frontend integration

## Modified Files:

- backend/main.py (added `/api/sessions/{session_id}/conversation/full` endpoint)
- frontend/src/types/api.ts (added conversation history types)
- frontend/src/services/api.ts (added getSessionConversationFull method)
- frontend/src/components/ConversationWorkflow.tsx (created new component)
- frontend/src/App.tsx (integrated workflow view and toggle functionality)

## Key Features Implemented:

### Backend Enhancements:

- **New API Endpoint**: `/api/sessions/{session_id}/conversation/full` returns complete conversation history
- **Rich Data Structure**: Preserves all tool calls, reasoning steps, and agent outputs
- **Type Safety**: Proper error handling and response formatting

### Frontend Workflow Component:

- **Visual Tool Timeline**: Color-coded representation of agent workflow
- **Tool-Specific Icons**: FileText, Terminal, Search, Brain, etc. for different operations
- **Rich Formatting**: JSON arguments and outputs with syntax highlighting
- **Interactive Display**: Collapsible sections and organized layout
- **Step-by-Step View**: Shows user requests, reasoning, tool calls, and outputs

### UI/UX Improvements:

- **Toggle Button**: Switch between chat view and workflow view
- **Color Coding**: Blue for user, green for agent, purple for reasoning, orange for tools
- **Responsive Design**: Proper spacing and mobile-friendly layout
- **Data Truncation**: Long content automatically truncated for readability

### Technical Implementation:

- **TypeScript Integration**: Comprehensive typing for conversation items
- **Error Handling**: Graceful fallbacks for malformed data
- **Performance**: Efficient rendering of large conversation histories
- **State Management**: Proper React state management for workflow data

## User Experience:

Users can now:

1. Select any existing session with conversation history
2. Click "Show Workflow" button to see detailed agent workflow
3. View complete tool call timeline with arguments and outputs
4. See agent reasoning steps between tool calls
5. Toggle back to normal chat view anytime

## Technical Architecture:

```
Backend: FastAPI endpoint → Full conversation history JSON
Frontend: API call → TypeScript types → React component → Rich UI
```

## Command Outputs:

- Backend health check: ✅ Server running on port 8000
- API endpoint test: ✅ Returns full conversation data
- Frontend integration: ✅ Component renders workflow correctly

## Duration:

Approximately 45 minutes of focused development
